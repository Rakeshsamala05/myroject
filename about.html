            <h1>MAHARISHI</h1>
            <p>
                This initiative was proposed in G20 MACS meeting in April 
                2023 in India and endorsed by G20 MACS participants to contribute 
                to improving world food and nutritional security through bringing
                 millets in global consumer’s diet.This initiative provides a 
                 framework to establish strategic research and organization priorities 
                 for millet research at the international level in both developed and 
                 developing countries. The MAHARISHI fosters communication between the
                  research community, funders and global policy makers and aims at securing
                   efficient and long-term investments to meet millet research and development
                    goals. It also initiates and supports activities in order to enhance 
                    communication and increase access of all to information, resources,
                     and technologies with respect to millets.

            <h1>Purpose of the MAHARISHI</h1>
            <p>
                Millets are small seeded, hardy grass species which include sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, proso millet, kodo millet, little millet, barnyard millet, and brown-top millet. Apart from these there are other ancient grains that are consumed as food which include teff, fonio, sekia, job’s tears, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa etc. These food grains have disappeared from main stream food platter and replaced with wheat and rice. Millets and ancient grains are nutritious and contain many health benefiting constituents for human, hence honoured with name ‘shri-anna’ (Indian Parliament) which means divine food. Millets are hardy crop which are inherently resilient to biotic and abiotic stress. 

The crisis looming due to climate change, depleting natural resources, increasing CO2 concentration and temperature has must be addressed. Millets and ancient grains are less resource intensive for cultivation and provide solution to sustainable agriculture. MAHARISHI is an opportunity highlighting the research challenges relevant across the globe and provides platform for combined and coordinated action across the research community offers our best options for success.

                <strong style="font-size: 2rem; text-decoration:underline;"> Rediscovering the Power of Millets and Ancient Grains</strong>
                <br><br>
                Millets and ancient grains have long been the foundation of 
                sustainable food systems, nourishing communities across the globe.
                 Yet, in recent decades, these resilient and nutritious crops have
                  been overshadowed by the rise in intensive mono-cropping. However,
                   with the mounting challenges of climate change, food insecurity, 
                   and health crises, the millets and ancient grans are rediscovered 
                   for their incredible potential. This initiative, MAHARISHI, aims to 
                   revive and elevate millets and ancient grains, empowering farmers,
                    improving nutrition, and fostering a more sustainable future for all.
                    <br><br>
                    Millets are the most versatile crops which can be 
                grown in diverse agroclimatic condition. These crops
                 have wide adaptation and most suited for the current
                  agrarian vulnerabilities viz. climate change, drought, 
                  depleting natural resources, rise in CO2 and temperature etc. 
                  \Paleo-botanical studies revealed that millets and other ancient 
                  \crops were the first choice of the early human settlers worldwide.
                   Most of the millets and the ancient grain crops are C4, which means
                   \ they have better water, nutrient and radiation use efficiency. They
                    are also resilient to abiotic stress and resistance to pest and diseases.

        <h2>1. Diverse Adaptability
        </h2>
        <div class="text-millets">
            Millets are a remarkably versatile group of small-seeded grasses that can thrive in a wide range of environments,
             from arid regions to tropical climates. These hardy crops are well-suited to cope with the challenges posed by
              climate change, including drought, heat, and poor soil conditions.

        <h2>2. Nutritional Powerhouses</h2>
        <div class="text-millets" >
            Millets are nutritional powerhouses, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
             They are particularly rich in protein, calcium, iron, and antioxidants, making them a valuable 
             addition to any healthy diet. Millets also have a low glycemic index, making them a suitable
             option for those with diabetes or those seeking to manage their blood sugar levels.

      <div class="box">
        <h2>3. Sustainable Cultivation</h2>
        <div class="text-millets" >
            Millets require fewer resources to cultivate compared to traditional cereal crops, 
            making them a more environmentally-friendly choice. They have a shorter growing season,
             lower water demands, and can be grown with minimal or no chemical inputs, aligning with 
             the principles of sustainable agriculture
